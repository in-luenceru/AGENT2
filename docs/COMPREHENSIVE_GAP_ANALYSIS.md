# Comprehensive Gap Analysis: Extracted Agent vs Full Wazuh Agent

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis of the extracted agent versus the full Wazuh codebase, significant gaps have been identified that prevent the extracted agent from functioning as a complete security monitoring solution. While the basic framework and configuration structure exist, critical components are missing or replaced with mock implementations.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working (Confirmed)
- **Basic Agent Framework**: Core directory structure and configuration files exist
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Basic syscheck functionality is configured
- **Manager Communication**: Agent can connect and communicate with Wazuh manager
- **Configuration Parsing**: ossec.conf is properly structured and parsed
- **Build System**: CMake build system and Makefiles are present
- **Also we had changed the Agent name to montoring**: we did a complete name change to monitoring Agent

### ❌ Critical Missing Components 

#### 1. **BINARY EXECUTABLES (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Current Status**: Mock shell scripts instead of compiled C binaries
```bash
# Current mock implementation:
/workspaces/AGENT2/bin/wazuh-agentd     → Shell script mock
/workspaces/AGENT2/bin/wazuh-logcollector → Shell script mock  
/workspaces/AGENT2/bin/wazuh-syscheckd   → Shell script mock
/workspaces/AGENT2/bin/wazuh-modulesd    → Shell script mock
/workspaces/AGENT2/bin/wazuh-execd       → Shell script mock
```

**Required**: Compiled C binaries from source code:
- `wazuh-agentd` - Core agent daemon
- `wazuh-logcollector` - Log collection engine
- `wazuh-syscheckd` - File integrity monitoring daemon
- `wazuh-modulesd` - Modules management daemon
- `wazuh-execd` - Active response execution daemon

#### 2. **WODLES (CLOUD INTEGRATIONS) - MISSING**
**Impact**: No cloud security monitoring capabilities

Missing wodles directory with Python modules:
```
wodles/
├── aws/           # AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty
├── azure/         # Azure Activity Logs, NSG Flow Logs
├── gcloud/        # Google Cloud Security Command Center
├── docker-listener/ # Docker container monitoring
└── utils.py       # Common wodle utilities
```

#### 3. **COMPREHENSIVE RULESET - SEVERELY LIMITED**
**Current**: Only 2 SCA policy files
**Required**: 74 SCA security configuration assessment policies

Missing critical security policies for:
- CIS benchmarks (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- PCI DSS compliance
- NIST compliance  
- SOC 2 compliance
- Custom security policies

#### 4. **LOG ANALYSIS AND DECODERS - MISSING**
**Impact**: No log parsing and security event detection

Missing components:
- Event decoders for different log formats
- Security rules for threat detection
- Log format parsers
- Regular expression patterns for log analysis

#### 5. **ROOTKIT DETECTION - LIMITED**
**Current**: Basic rootcheck module exists in source
**Missing**: 
- Rootkit signature databases
- Behavioral analysis patterns
- System call monitoring
- Kernel module detection

#### 6. **VULNERABILITY SCANNING - INCOMPLETE**
**Current**: Source code exists but not integrated
**Missing**:
- CVE databases
- Vulnerability feed updates
- Package vulnerability correlation
- Network vulnerability scanning

#### 7. **ACTIVE RESPONSE - LIMITED**
**Current**: Basic framework exists
**Missing**:
- Response script libraries
- Firewall integration scripts
- Automated threat mitigation
- Custom response templates
