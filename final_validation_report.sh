cat << 'EOF'

For production network scanning detection, implement:

1. 🔧 SERVICE-BASED DETECTION:
   - Install SSH, HTTP, FTP services 
   - Configure verbose logging
   - Monitor auth.log, access.log

2. 🔧 NETWORK-LEVEL MONITORING:
   - Enable iptables logging
   - Configure netfilter logs  
   - Add fail2ban integration

3. 🔧 CUSTOM RULES:
   - Process monitoring (nmap, masscan)
   - Connection pattern analysis
   - Threshold-based alerting

4. 🔧 EXTERNAL SCANNING:
   - Use separate attack machine
   - Target actual services
   - Monitor service logs
