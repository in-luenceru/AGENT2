echo "🎯 Expected Wazuh Rule Matches:"
echo "--------------------------------"
echo "• Rule 100001: Network file system mounted (Level 3)"
echo "• Rule 100002: Suspicious NFS mount with write permissions (Level 7)"  
echo "• Rule 100003: CIFS/SMB network share mounted (Level 5)"

echo "📋 Log Entries Created:"
echo "----------------------"

echo
echo "🔧 To integrate with Wazuh agent:"
echo "1. Add this log file to localfile monitoring in ossec.conf"
echo "2. The agent will process these events using our custom rules"
echo "3. Alerts will be generated based on rule severity levels"
echo "4. Active response can be triggered for high-severity events"

echo "- Suspicious executable on network share (Level 8)"
echo
